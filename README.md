# Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'
This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript error: assigning a string value to a variable that is declared as a number.  The error message is: `Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.ts(2322)`

The `bug.ts` file shows the problematic code.  The `bugSolution.ts` file offers a solution, showing how to correct the type mismatch.

This example highlights the importance of type safety in TypeScript.  By clearly defining the types of variables, TypeScript helps catch errors early during development, leading to more robust code.
